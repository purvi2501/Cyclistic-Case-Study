After the initial data cleaning in Excel, I used BigQuery for further data cleaning. The following SQL queries highlight the same. 
First, all the .CSV files were uploaded on Google Drive and using file URIs, the tables were uploaded in BigQuery under a dataset called ‘bike_share’. 

## Checking for Outliers
  
  -	Latitude and longitude coordinates can show potential outliers. Chicago’s official coordinates are 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. Therefore, all rides must take place         within these coordinates. 
  
  -	 A query was run to find out the maximum and minimum coordinate values for ‘start_lat,’ ‘start_lng’, ‘end_lat’, and ‘end_lng’.  
  
      ```bigquery
      SELECT 
            MIN(start_lat) AS min_start_lat, 
            MAX(start_lat) AS max_start_lat, 
            MIN(start_lng) AS min_start_lng, 
            MAX(start_lng) AS max_start_lng, 
            MIN(end_lat) AS min_end_lat, 
            MAX(end_lat) AS max_end_lat, 
            MIN(end_lng) AS min_end_lng, 
            MAX(end_lng) AS max_end_lat
      FROM `mydataproject64995.bike_share.cs1_consolidated_data`;
      
      ```

          # Results indicate that min(end_lat) and max(end_lng) have values of 0.0 which are not possible since Chicago's coordinates are 41.8781° N, 87.6298° W. This implies that all trips must happen within these coordinates. Therefore, rows where 'end_lat = 0.0' and 'end_lng = 0.0' shall be removed. Since BigQuery Sandbox does not support the DELETE statement, a table without these rows will be viewed and materialized.
