# Data_Cleaning

The .CSV files were first opened in MS-Excel for initial data cleaning and preparation. The following process was used to clean each table:

## Checking for Duplicates
  
  1.	Checking for duplicates: Each table was checked for duplicates. It was found that there were no duplicates in any table. This is likely because data has been         already anonymized. ‘ride_id’ is unique for each ride, irrespective of the user. 

## Sorting & Filtering

  2.	Next, each file was formatted as a table for sorting and filtering. Then, the ‘started_at’ column was sorted by oldest to newest to show the first date of the       month at the top. 

## Data Manipulation
  3.	Next, the ‘started_at’ and ‘ended_at’ columns were standardized by changing their format from ‘mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm’ to ‘yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.’ This was done to           extract accurate date and time data. 

  4.	Eight columns were added after the ‘ended_at’ column, namely ‘start_date’, ‘end_date’, start_time’, ‘end_time, ride_length’, ‘num_of_days’,                           ‘start_day_of_week’, and ‘month’.
    
        -	‘start_date’ and ‘end_date’  indicate each ride’s start and end dates in the format ‘yyyy-mm-dd’. 
    
        -	Similarly, ‘start_time’ and ‘end_time’ indicate each ride’s start and end times in the format ‘hh:mm:ss’. These will help in the calculation of the                   duration of each ride (ride_length), which is the difference between start time and end time.

        -	‘num_of_days’ refers to the difference between the start and end dates. Ideally, this should be 0 or 1. Numbers above 1 may amount to false records due the            pricing plan structure. The plan has three types, single-ride passes, full-day passes and annual memberships, details of which are not known. However, it            would be safe to assume that these plans have a certain time limit per ride and additional charges per minute may be applicable after the allotted ride              time is over. Therefore, the ‘num_of_days’ should ideally be either 0 or 1. 

        -	‘start_day_of_week’ refers to the numeric day of the week, where 1 = ‘Sunday’ and 7 = ‘Saturday’.

        -	Finally, ‘month’ refers to the month in which each ride occurs. This too is numbered, where 1 = ‘January’ and 12 = ‘December’. 

   5.	Using functions and formulae to populate these columns:
        
        -	The ‘start_date’ and ‘end_date’ columns were populated using the ‘=INT ()’ function and were custom formatted as ‘yyyy-mm-dd.’
    
        -	The ‘start_time’ and ‘end_time’ columns were populated using the ‘=MOD ()’ function where the divisor was 1. This was custom formatted as ‘hh:mm:ss’ .
    
        -	‘ride_length´ was calculated using the formula ‘=end_time – start_time’. This, however, resulted in hashtags in some cells. To find out the actual duration            of each ride, the following function was used:
                                          
                                          =IF (end_time < start_time, (1 + end_time) – start_time, end_time – start_time)

        To ensure the results from this function were accurate, the results were validated using a time calculator found on the web. This was further custom                 formatted as ‘hh:mm:ss.’
     
        -	The ‘start_day_of_week’ column was populated using the ‘=WEEKDAY()’ function, where 1 = ‘Sunday’ and 7 = ‘Saturday’. The results were formatted as                   ‘General.’

        -	The ‘num_of_days’ column was populated using the ‘=DAYS()’ function which calculates the difference between a start date and an end date. The results were           formatted as ‘General.’
      
        -	Finally, the ‘month’ column was populated using the ‘=MONTH()’ function, where 1 = ‘January’ and 12 = ‘December’. The results were formatted as ‘General.’

    6.	Next, the original ‘started_at’ and ‘ended_at’ columns were deleted after the newly created columns were copied and pasted as ‘Values’.
